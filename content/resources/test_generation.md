description: 'This file describes a novel technique for automatically generating a
  suite of test inputs to an object-oriented procedure. The

  suite is guaranteed to kill all mutant procedures produced from a given catalog
  of mutation operators, so long as those mutants could be detected by some test within
  user-provided bounds.'
